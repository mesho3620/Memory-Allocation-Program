steps to use the program:
-add the memory holes first by setting the:
	=hole size
	=starting address (not displayed)
program will pop an error message to the user if hole size/starting address is not an integer
-add processes by setting their size;
-press the Allocate Process then choose the algorithm (first fit/ best fit/ worst fit) to use in allocation
NOTE:
the output displays every process allocated in each hole on the console( Not in a GUI page)

NOTES:
-the .exe and .jar are located in the "dist" folder
-class "hole" contains an arraylist to save allocated processes in the current hole
-class memory contains the allocation algorithms
-holes' addresses overlapping was not fixed
